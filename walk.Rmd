## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages('xlsx', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library("xlsx")
rep =read.xlsx("Walk-in Report.xlsx", sheetIndex = 2,header = TRUE,colIndex = c(13,10),
startRow = 1,endRow = 32)
rep

#(dtab<-table(rep))
#barplot(table(rep))
#barplot(dtab, ylim=c(0,30), xlab="r" ,ylab="z",col="red",main= "Test Report")
#beer.counts = table(rep)
#pie(beer.counts) = x
beer.counts = table (rep)
#pie(beer.counts)
pie(beer.counts)
#names(beer.counts) = c("Aravind DB","Direct walkin",
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
